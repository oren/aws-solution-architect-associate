## Performance Effiniency

Design Principles
* Democratize advanced technologies
* Go global in minutes
* GUse serverless architectures
* GExperiment more often
* GMechanical sympathy


### Areas

**Compute**

Questions
* How do you select the best performing architecture?
* How do you select your compute solution?
* How do you configure your networking solution?

**Storage**

Optimal storage depeds on the following:
* Access Method - block, file, or object
* Patterns of Access - random or sequestial
* Throughput required
* Frequency of Access - online, offline, or archival
* Frequency of Update - worm, dynamic
* Availability Constraints
* Durability Constraints

Questions
* How do you select your storage solution?
* How do you ensure that you continue to have the most appropriate storage solution as new storage solutions and features are launched?
* How do you monitor your resources to ensure they are performing as expected?
* How do you ensure that the capacity and throughput of your storage solutions maches demand?

**Databases**

Optimal database solution depedns on the following: consistency, high availability, No-SQL, DR

Questions
* How do you select your database solution?
* How do you keep track of what's new in the database world?
* How do you monitor the performance of your database?
* How do you ensure that the capacity and throughput of your dbs matches demand?

Solutions
* Reduce load on your database and reduce latency with RDS read replicas
* Predictable latency between your office and AWS using Direct Connect
* Reduce latency by adding infrastructure in the region close to your cutsomers
* Reduce latency by cache stuff - ElastiCache or CloudFront
